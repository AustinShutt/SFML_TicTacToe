# SFML_TicTacToe
  Here is an implementation of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. It is a game featuring two players in which players alternate placing either 
  an "X" or an "O" within a board of 3x3 possible spaces. To win, a player must connect three of the same pieces in either a row, column, or
  diagonal in any direction. If all spaces are taken before a winning condition is reached the game is a draw and the board is reset.
  
   This implementation was created with both a local multiplayer variant in which the turn is shifted from the X player to the O player after
  each piece is placed, but it also contains a single-player mode that pits you up against the unbeatable min-max algorithm in which with best
  possible play you will be left with a tie.

  If using Visual Studio you should be able to download the repository and run immediately as long as you are running in x86. Thanks for taking
  the time to look at my repository! Feel free to use any part of this code for your own purposes and reach out to me with any questions you 
  may have!
